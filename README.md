**Abstract:**  
Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, and early detection
is crucial for improving patient outcomes. In recent years, deep learning has emerged
as a promising approach for automated cancer detection and classification. In this thesis,
we propose a framework for using deep learning models to detect and classify colorectal
cancer based on histopathological images. We investigate the performance of different
deep learning architectures, including convolutional neural networks, on a dataset of colorectal
cancer images. Our results demonstrate the potential of deep learning models
for accurately detecting and classifying colorectal cancer, with an accuracy of over 99.2%
achieved in some cases. We also discuss the limitations and challenges of using deep
learning for cancer detection and provide recommendations for future research. Overall,
our study highlights the potential of deep learning as a powerful tool for improving cancer
diagnosis and treatment.
